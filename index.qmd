## Abstract

This project investigates how access to mental health care in the past 4 weeks varied by state, gender, and time during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using the U.S. Census Bureauâ€™s Household Pulse Survey, I created an interactive dashboard to visualize trends and differences in mental health care receipt, providing insights to guide public health policy and outreach.

## Key Questions

1. Did mental health care access change across different time periods during the pandemic?
2. Were there noticeable differences in access across gender and geographic location?
