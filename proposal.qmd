## Description 
The dataset titled "Mental Health Care in the Last 4 Weeks" comes from the U.S. Census Bureau’s Household Pulse Survey
and focuses on how many adults in the United States received mental health care—including therapy, counseling,
or prescriptions—during the last four weeks at the time of survey collection. It includes state-level data and allows
breakdowns by week, gender, and other demographic details. This information is especially useful for understanding
how access to mental health care may have varied during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The file has {{ mh_data.shape[0] }} rows and {{ mh_data.shape[1] }} columns. Some key columns include state, week, group
(e.g., gender or age category), value (estimate), and confidence intervals. I chose this dataset because it highlights
mental health care access across the U.S. during a critical time and is structured well for visual comparisons across
groups and over time.

## Questions

1. Which U.S. states had the highest and lowest rates of adults receiving mental health care during the COVID-19 
pandemic period captured in this dataset?

2. How did access to mental health care differ between demographic groups—such as men and women—over the course of 
the survey weeks?



## Analysis plan

To start the project, I will clean the dataset by handling any missing values and checking for consistent formats
in columns like week, state, and group. I’ll then explore the data by grouping it based on demographic and geographic
categories to understand how mental health care access changed over time and across regions.

For analysis, I plan to generate bar charts comparing state-level access to care, as well as line graphs to show trends
over time for different demographic groups (e.g., comparing mental health care access between men and women week by week).
After exploring these trends, I’ll develop an interactive dashboard using Streamlit or Plotly Express that allows users
to select specific weeks, groups, or states and view custom visualizations. This tool will make the data easy to explore 
and help reveal key differences and changes in access to care.
